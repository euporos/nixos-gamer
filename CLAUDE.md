# nixos-gamer

Flake-based NixOS config for the headless AI host at `192.168.85.30`
(hostname `nixos-gamer`, user `phylax`, root SSH works). Despite the name it is
not for gaming — the name comes from the Windows dual-boot on the same machine.

## Deploy

```sh
nix run .#deploy
```

Pushes the current branch to origin, then `nixos-rebuild switch` over SSH with
`--build-host == --target-host` — evaluation is local, building happens on the
box. Never build locally for the box; its internet is faster.

The deploy target is `root@gamer-nixos` — `gamer-nixos` is an alias in the
local `~/.ssh/config` (HostName 192.168.85.30, ForwardAgent yes); deploying
from a machine without that alias needs it added first.

## Hardware constraints (violating these breaks the box)

- **GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti (Pascal, sm_61).** Consequences:
  - NVIDIA driver must stay on `nvidiaPackages.legacy_580` — the last branch
    with Pascal support (`production` ≥ 590 dropped it). See `nvidia.nix`.
  - PyTorch ≥ 2.8 CUDA wheels have **no sm_61 kernels** — anything torch-based
    must use torch ≤ 2.7.x or it dies with "no kernel image is available".
    This is why the WhisperX container image in `whisper.nix` is pinned to a
    2024 build (torch 2.1.1). Do not bump it to a floating tag.
  - No usable fp16 on Pascal; CTranslate2/faster-whisper runs `int8` (dp4a).
  - **Ollama (summarization) has the same sm_61 trap** — but a different fix.
    This nixpkgs' default `cudaCapabilities` is `7.5 8.0 … 12.1` (it OMITS
    `6.1`), so a stock `ollama-cuda` would ship with no Pascal kernels and die
    identically with "no kernel image is available". The default CUDA here is
    **12.9, which still supports Pascal**, so the fix is simply forcing the arch:
    `nixpkgs.config.cudaCapabilities = [ "6.1" ]` in `summarize.nix` (only
    ollama is CUDA-built, so scoping to this one GPU is correct). This compiles
    ollama-cuda from source for sm_61 (not in the binary cache — a one-time
    remote build). Do **not** let the default CUDA float to 13.x — CUDA 13
    dropped Pascal at the compiler level, so 6.1 would no longer even build.
- **The ESP is a tiny 96MB Windows-created partition** (`nvme0n1p1`, mounted at
  `/boot/efi`) shared with the Microsoft bootloader (~27MB). It is boxed in
  between the disk start and the Windows partitions, so it **cannot be grown**.
  - **Bootloader is GRUB, on purpose** (`configuration.nix`). systemd-boot
    (Boot Loader Spec) copies kernel+initrd (~38MB/gen) ONTO the ESP per
    generation; two *differing* generations + Windows overflow 96MB → ENOSPC
    mid-deploy on the next kernel bump. GRUB reads kernel/initrd straight from
    `/nix/store` on the ext4 root and puts only a small stub on the ESP, so the
    per-generation ESP growth is gone and there is no generation limit. The
    `euporos` laptop runs the same setup (identical Windows-first 96MB ESP).
  - Mount layout: ESP at `/boot/efi` (`hardware-configuration.nix`); `/boot` is
    a plain dir on the ext4 root holding `grub/grub.cfg` (kernels stay in the
    store, not copied). Do **not** revert the ESP to mounting at `/boot`.
  - Migrating the bootloader (or reinstalling GRUB) needs
    `NIXOS_INSTALL_BOOTLOADER=1` / `nixos-rebuild switch --install-bootloader`
    — a plain switch will not rewrite the ESP stub.
  - **Boot resilience (why the ESP can't brick the box):** Windows keeps
    setting the FAT dirty bit on this shared ESP (Fast Startup / updates), which
    fails `systemd-fsck@boot-efi`. The ESP is therefore `nofail` +
    `x-systemd.device-timeout=5s` (`hardware-configuration.nix`) — a failed
    fsck/mount is non-fatal and boot continues, because the ESP is only needed
    at rebuild time (GRUB stub), never at runtime. Belt-and-suspenders,
    `systemd.enableEmergencyMode = false` (`configuration.nix`) means *any*
    boot fault continues to `multi-user.target` (network + sshd) instead of a
    dead console root-password prompt. Without both, a dirty ESP dropped the
    headless box to emergency mode = remotely dead until someone walked over
    with a keyboard.
  - **Deploy caveat — degraded ⇒ remount ESP first:** because of `nofail`, when
    the ESP got skipped at boot it stays *unmounted* and
    `systemctl is-system-running` reports `degraded`. Before the next
    `nix run .#deploy`, ssh in and
    `fsck.vfat -aw /dev/disk/by-uuid/EC72-7C23 && mount /boot/efi` — otherwise
    GRUB writes its stub to the empty `/boot/efi` dir on the ext4 root instead
    of the real ESP, and the bootloader silently isn't updated.

## Wake-on-LAN + remote OS selection

The box is off most of the time and dual-boots NixOS/Windows. WoL powers it on
but **cannot pick the OS** — the magic packet only says "power on". The flow:

- **Wake it**: from any LAN machine, `wakeonlan c8:fe:0f:fd:66:93` (the wired NIC
  `enp8s0`; `nix-shell -p wakeonlan`). WoL is enabled via a systemd `.link`
  file (`networking.interfaces."enp8s0".wakeOnLan.enable` in
  `configuration.nix`), applied by udev on every boot. Also needs the firmware
  "Power On by PCI-E/onboard LAN" setting on. Verify with
  `ethtool enp8s0 | grep Wake-on` → want `g`.
- **Which OS**: NixOS is the GRUB default entry, so WoL always lands in NixOS
  (the SSH-reachable OS). To boot Windows *once*, SSH in and run
  `grub-reboot "<Windows entry>" && systemctl reboot` — GRUB boots Windows next
  (one-shot via grubenv), then reverts to the NixOS default. Find the exact
  entry name (os-prober-generated) in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` (a `menuentry
  "Windows Boot Manager …"`). Going back: just restart Windows (lands on the
  NixOS default).
- **Windows gotcha**: disable Windows Fast Startup, or a "shutdown" is really
  hibernation (S4) and the NIC won't honor the magic packet from that state.

## Secrets (sops-nix)

Secrets are age-encrypted and **checked into the repo** as ciphertext
(`secrets/secrets.yaml`), decrypted on the box at `nixos-rebuild` activation.
This replaced the old hand-placed plaintext files
(`/var/lib/whisper/hf-token.env`, `/etc/nixos/secrets/smb-secrets`).

- **Files**: `flake.nix` pulls the `sops-nix` input and adds
  `sops-nix.nixosModules.sops`; `sops.nix` declares the secrets and the
  decryption identity; `.sops.yaml` lists the recipients; `secrets/secrets.yaml`
  holds the ciphertext. Consumers read `config.sops.secrets.<name>.path`
  (`whisper.nix` → `hf-token`, `configuration.nix` CIFS mount → `smb-secrets`).
- **Recipients** (both can decrypt every secret): the operator's **admin age
  key**, held in `pass` at `admin-age-keys/universal` (lets a human edit); and
  the box's **SSH host key** `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key` (lets the machine
  decrypt at activation — never leaves the box, never in the repo). The host
  recipient is `age1xp2glg…`; regenerate it after any host-key change with
  `ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 192.168.85.30 | ssh-to-age`, update `.sops.yaml`,
  then `sops updatekeys secrets/secrets.yaml`.
- **Decrypted paths**: `/run/secrets/<name>` (tmpfs, mode 0400 root). The
  whisper worker and mount.cifs both run as root, so 0400-root is fine.
- **Edit the secrets** (operator, on a machine holding the admin key):
  ```
  SOPS_AGE_KEY="$(pass show admin-age-keys/universal | grep -v '^#')" \
    nix-shell -p sops --run 'sops secrets/secrets.yaml'
  ```
  Keys: `hf-token` = `HF_TOKEN=hf_…` (whole env-file line, the worker sources
  it); `smb-secrets` = a `username=`/`password=` block. **Run `pass` yourself**
  — the Claude Code harness is hard-blocked from invoking it (a global
  PreToolUse guard), so Claude handles only public data (age *recipients*),
  never the private key or plaintext secret values.
- **Ordering**: secrets materialize at activation, before the (lazy,
  `x-systemd.automount`) NAS mount and the path-triggered whisper worker ever
  need them — no boot-time race.

## Whisper transcription pipeline (`whisper.nix`)

- Web UI: `http://192.168.85.30:8990/` — single static page
  (`whisper-ui/index.html`, no build step, no backend daemon). It polls nginx
  `autoindex_format json` listings under `/status/{inbox,work,failed,transcripts}/`
  to show all jobs (including CLI/scp uploads), and cancels/requeues by
  PUTting `<name>.cancel` / `<name>.requeue` sentinels to `/control/`, handled
  by the `whisper-control` path unit (kills the `whisper-job` podman
  container, or moves files between inbox/ and failed/). A cancelled job's
  audio lands in `failed/` like any failure.
- Upload: `curl -T file.m4a http://192.168.85.30:8990/` (nginx WebDAV PUT,
  atomic rename into `/srv/whisper/inbox`), or scp into that dir.
- systemd path unit + 10-min sweep timer → `whisper-worker` (bash, runs as
  root) → one-shot rootful podman job per file with `--device
  nvidia.com/gpu=all` (CDI). No VRAM held between jobs; ~15× realtime.
- Results in `/srv/whisper/transcripts/` (`.txt/.srt/.vtt/.tsv/.json` +
  jq-generated `.speakers.txt`); audio → `processed/`, failures → `failed/`
  (requeue = move back to inbox). Logs: `journalctl -u whisper-worker`.
- **NAS delivery**: on success the worker also copies the output set into
  `/media/NAS/Netspace/artifacts/transcriptions/<stem>/` — one folder per
  transcript. The local `/srv/whisper/transcripts/` (flat) stays the source of
  truth the web UI browses/polls; the NAS copy is the shareable deliverable.
  Delivery is **best-effort**: the share is an automounted CIFS mount (`nofail`
  + `x-systemd.automount`, `configuration.nix`) so an offline NAS only logs a
  `WARN` and never fails a job — the local copy is retained and can be
  re-synced. The CIFS `username=`/`password=` credentials are the `smb-secrets`
  entry in the encrypted `secrets/secrets.yaml`, decrypted by sops-nix to
  `/run/secrets/smb-secrets` at activation (see **Secrets (sops-nix)** below).
  Until that entry has real values the mount can't authenticate and delivery
  just WARNs.
- The container user is uid 1001 == host user `whisper` (fixed uid, on
  purpose — bind-mounted job dirs rely on it).
- The image's whisperx downloads its VAD model from a **dead S3 bucket**; the
  worker pre-seeds the sha-verified file into `/var/cache/whisperx/torch/`
  from the whisperX repo's bundled asset. Keep that seeding step.
- **Dual-channel (one speaker per channel)**: the UI's "one speaker per
  channel" checkbox inserts a `.2ch` marker before the extension (e.g.
  `talk.2ch.m4a`); `curl -T talk.m4a http://…/talk.2ch.m4a` triggers it too.
  The worker then ffprobe-verifies 2 channels, ffmpeg-splits L/R into 16 kHz
  mono, runs WhisperX once per channel (json only, **no diarization**), and a
  stdlib Python helper (`whisper-merge.py`) interleaves the segments by start
  time into `SPEAKER_L`/`SPEAKER_R`, emitting the full format set. The `.2ch`
  marker is stripped from every output name. A file wrongly marked (not really
  stereo) falls back to normal transcription. This is exact and free of the HF
  token — prefer it whenever speakers are physically channel-separated.
- **Language**: the pinned image's entrypoint bakes `--language de` (env
  `LANG=de`), so the default is German. The worker overrides it per-job by
  passing `--language <code>` *after* the baked flag (whisperx argparse takes
  the last value). A `.lang-XX` filename marker (UI dropdown, or curl to
  `…/talk.lang-en.m4a`) selects the language; supported: `de` (default), `en`,
  `ru`, `fr`. Non-German alignment models download from HF at runtime (the box
  has internet); `de`'s alignment model is baked into the `-de` image tag.
  Adding a language means: add the `.lang-XX` case in the worker's marker
  loop **and** an `<option>` in the UI — nothing else. Marker is stripped from
  output names, and combines with `.2ch` in any order.
- Speaker diarization only activates when the `hf-token` secret decrypts to a
  `HF_TOKEN=hf_…` line at `/run/secrets/hf-token` (gated pyannote models; user
  must accept terms of `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` and
  `pyannote/segmentation-3.0` on huggingface.co). Without it, transcription
  runs but speakers show as `SPEAKER_?`. Status: token installed since
  2026-07-19 (now carried in `secrets/secrets.yaml`) — diarization active.
- nginx runs under `ProtectSystem=strict`; the inbox is whitelisted via
  `ReadWritePaths`. New writable paths for nginx need the same treatment.

## Summarization pipeline (`summarize.nix`)

Summarize a transcript via a local **Ollama running Qwen3 14B** (GGUF Q4) on the
1080 Ti. Unlike WhisperX this is not a PyTorch problem — Ollama ships its own
llama.cpp CUDA kernels; the Pascal fix is the `cudaCapabilities` pin above.

- **Endpoint**: `POST http://192.168.85.30:8990/summarize` — an nginx `= /`
  exact-match location that proxies to a small stdlib-Python server on
  `127.0.0.1:8991` (`whisper-summarize.service`, `DynamicUser` in the `whisper`
  group). The location is defined in `summarize.nix` but **merges into the
  `whisper` vhost declared in `whisper.nix`** (NixOS merges `locations` across
  modules); exact-match beats the `/` PUT-inbox catch-all, so uploads are
  unaffected. Port 8991 is never firewalled — only 8990 (nginx) is public.
- **Request** (JSON): `text` (inline transcript) **or** `file` (a bare name
  resolved under `/srv/whisper/transcripts`, or an absolute path that must
  canonicalize *inside* that dir — traversal/symlink-out is rejected), plus
  optional `prompt` (extra instructions, appended to the base summarizer
  system prompt), `language`, `model`, `num_ctx`, `temperature`, `keep_alive`.
  A raw (non-JSON) body is taken verbatim as the transcript; extra instructions
  then come from the `X-Summarize-Prompt` header. Response: `{"summary","model"}`.
- The server sends `think:false` (Qwen3 is a thinking model) and strips any
  stray `<think>…</think>` defensively, for clean, fast summaries.
- **VRAM (11 GB, shared with whisper) — GPU lock**: Qwen3-14B weights are ~9 GB
  and a whisper job also needs the card, so the two are mutually excluded by an
  `flock` on `/run/whisper-gpu.lock` (tmpfiles-created `0660 root:whisper`). The
  whisper worker takes it around each container run (`run_whisperx` in
  `whisper.nix`); the summarizer takes it around its Ollama call **and** holds it
  until the model is confirmed unloaded — `keep_alive` is forced to `0` and
  `/api/ps` is polled, so whisper never starts while the LLM is resident and
  vice versa. With one card the two genuinely serialize: a summary waits for an
  in-flight whisper job, and if that exceeds `SUMMARIZE_LOCK_TIMEOUT` (900s) the
  request returns **503** instead of hanging. The whisper side holds the lock
  per container run (not the whole inbox sweep), so summaries slip in between
  queued jobs. `keep_alive` is therefore no longer a request parameter.
- **Model provisioning**: `services.ollama.loadModels = [ "qwen3:14b" ]` pulls
  the model via a separate oneshot (`ollama-model-loader`) after ollama starts —
  it does not block the switch. First deploy: the model isn't ready until that
  pull finishes (~9 GB download); `journalctl -u ollama-model-loader` to watch.
- Only the endpoint exists so far — **no UI integration yet** (planned: quick
  "summarize" links from the whisper transcript browser).

## Gotchas

- First switch after enabling a kernel-module change (e.g. the NVIDIA driver)
  needs a reboot of the box; services like the CDI generator fail until then.
- `hardware-configuration.nix` carries real disk UUIDs — regenerate on the box,
  never hand-edit.
